The main rationale behind the second happy path was to go more in depth in the process of actually creating and editing the different parts of the quiz. As such, the user adds, deletes and edits questions of the quiz. This redirects them to the edit question page, where they are able to change the question, add options and images to the question itself. In addition, the second happy path went through the View Game path for the admin, so they could progress along the quiz and show a results screen as that is how the application is used with an audience.
